# GDD_Model

A GDD is a Game Development Document. Most people working in game development would tell you that it is one of the most important thing to make when starting a game : 
 * It keeps tracks of the progress made, and of the goals set,
 * It helps to organize he game by focusing on different aspects so that a team can work efficiently,
 * And most importantly, it tells customers what the game looks like and what it is about.

This project is a basic model of a wiki-styled web-based GDD. For now, it is just the start. I want to test it with my games ideas to see if it is operational, and when it will be, I will make it easily accessible for anyone interested.
